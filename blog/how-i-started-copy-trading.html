  <p>30 days ago, I didn’t even know what “copy trading” meant. I was scrolling on TikTok when I saw a guy earning daily just by copying other traders. I thought it was fake — but curiosity got me.</p>

  <p>I signed up for <strong>Bybit</strong> first — the platform looked clean, and they had a section where I could literally follow top traders. I chose one with a 70% win rate and clicked “Copy.” That was it.</p>

  <p>The first week was slow — small profits, small risks. But then one night, the market moved fast. I woke up to +14% in my account. That’s when I got hooked.</p>

  <p>I tried other platforms too. <strong>Bitget</strong> had more pro traders and analytics. Their futures tools were a bit advanced, but once I understood it — wow. I followed a scalper there and made 11 wins in a row.</p>

  <p>I didn’t become a millionaire — but I learned. And I grew. In 30 days, I turned ₱5,000 into ₱7,900. Not life-changing, but better than just holding and hoping.</p>

  <p>If you’re curious about trading but not ready to do it alone — <strong>copy trading</strong> is the best start. You learn by watching. You earn by following.</p>

  <p>And you don’t need to start big. All you need is to start.</p>
