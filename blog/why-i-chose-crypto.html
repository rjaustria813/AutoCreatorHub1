  <h1>Why I Chose Crypto Over a Traditional Job</h1>

  <p>Two years ago, I was in a stable job, clocking in 9 to 6, five days a week. The salary was okay. The environment was fine. But I felt stuck — not just financially, but mentally.</p>

  <p>Then I heard about people earning from home by trading crypto. Honestly, I thought it was all hype. But I started reading, watching videos, and following communities. That’s when I discovered platforms like <strong>Binance</strong>, <strong>Bybit</strong>, and <strong>OKX</strong>.</p>

  <p>I didn’t quit right away. I studied first. I used my lunch breaks to learn technical analysis and weekends to try copy trading. It was <strong>Bybit</strong> that helped me build confidence — being able to follow proven traders while I was still learning.</p>

  <p>Eventually, I made my first ₱1,000 profit. Then ₱3,200. Then a month came where I made more from trading than my job. That’s when the idea hit me: "What if I gave this my full energy?"</p>

  <p>When I finally resigned, people called me crazy. But looking back, that leap of faith gave me time, income, and freedom. Was it always smooth? No. But it was mine.</p>

  <p>I now use multiple exchanges depending on what I need. <strong>Bitget</strong> is my go-to for futures, while <strong>MEXC</strong> lets me trade with no KYC stress. Here are the platforms I trust most:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://partner.bybit.com/b/81181" target="_blank">Bybit – Copy Trading & Derivatives</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://partner.bitget.com/bg/gpty4gc4" target="_blank">Bitget – Futures Pro Tools</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.okx.com/join/TRADELENSAI" target="_blank">OKX – Smart DeFi Trading</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://promote.mexc.com/a/cTMqmWi6" target="_blank">MEXC – Instant No-KYC Access</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This isn’t about getting rich quick. It’s about building something real for yourself. And crypto gave me that chance — while most jobs only offered survival.</p>

  <p>Whatever path you choose, just make sure it leads to freedom. That’s what this space is about.</p>
